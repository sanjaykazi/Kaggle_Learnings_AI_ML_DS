# Feature Egineering

- We'll first establish a baseline by training the model on the un-augmented dataset. This will help us determine whether our new features are actually useful.
- Establishing baselines like this is good practice at the start of the feature engineering process. A baseline score can help you decide whether your new features are worth keeping, or whether you should discard them and possibly try something else.
